# Image-Preprocess-Lib

A couple scripts I wrote a while back to help with some Machine Learning-related tasks. Will add more later.

* crop_images.py - lets you quickly crop images
* resize_images.py - lets you quickly resize images to one fixed size (maintaining aspect ratio)
* label_images.py - lets you annotate images (plots points) for feature selection. writes labels to file

Much better descriptions available in the scripts.
